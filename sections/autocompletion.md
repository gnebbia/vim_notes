* `c-x c-f` "autocompletion for file names


A very nice trick with autocompletion is to press c-n c-p
to havee a real-time filtering list an works with any kind
of autocompletion. This is very useful when we have a lot
of suggestions, e.g., like 20 or more suggestions and we may
be confused with all that text, so in this case we can just press
c-n c-p and type some text to filter.

For example, let's say we want to filter on some filename and we
are currently in a directory with a lot of files, we can do:
`c-x c-f c-n c-p` and this will allow us to keep the list and type
some text in order to have a better filter.
