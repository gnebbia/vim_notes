Vim is without any doubt one of the most powerful text editors
out there. Anyway a newcomer who is starting to learn it can find it quite
confusing and not very intuitive.
The main reasons behind this confusion is that vim, is not similar to many of
the text editors, some of the major differences are:

* vim is a modal text editor;
* common shortcuts which are commmonly accepted among
  many applications (e.g., Ctrl+c, Ctrl+v, Ctrl+z) do not
  work in vim as expected;
* vim is mostly used from the command line;
* vim has too many "cryptic" commands to learn.

If we just consider these points, we could say from
a Human Computer Interaction perspective that modal tools
are unnecessarily complicated and non intuitive, and also when
designing a tool we should always make it more intuitive and user-friendly
as possible.
Indeed Jef Raskin -- a Human Computer Interaction expert -- once said:
*"Modes are a significant source of errors, confusion, unnecessary
restrictions, and complexity in interfaces."*
Anyway these considerations should not be followed when we talk about vim.
Indeed, User Interface theory generally is aimed at letting users spend as less
time as possible learning an interface.
Anyway vim experts know that in order to have a more proficient text editor
users should have a desire to learn, and this is a necessary
prerequisite in general to be a vim user.
So to sum up, UI experts don't take into account our ability
or desire to learn.
