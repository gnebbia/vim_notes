Given a number we can:

* `ctrl-a` increment it
* `ctrl-z` decrement it

We can create a list of increasing number starting from a list of zeros `0` by
selecting the interested lines and pressing:
* `g ctrl-a` creates an increasing list from the selected text (0, 1, 2, ...)
* `2 g ctrl-a` creates an increasing list by 2 from the selected text (2, 4, 6, ...)
